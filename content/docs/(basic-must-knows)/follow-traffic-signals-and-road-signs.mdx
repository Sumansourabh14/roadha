Traffic signals and road signs are there to **guide and protect us**. When everyone follows them, roads become safer and more organized.

## Why This Lesson Matters

- Ignoring signals leads to chaos and accidents.
- Road signs help you anticipate hazards and follow rules.
- Obeying signals is a basic civic responsibility.

## What Do Traffic Lights Mean?

- **🔴 Red = Stop**  
  You must stop your vehicle completely.

- **🟡 Yellow = Wait / Slow Down**  
  Get ready to stop or move carefully.

  > The point of a yellow light is to indicate to the road users that the light is about to turn red and that they should start slowing down and stopping. Every driver is required by law to stop at a yellow light unless they are too close to the junction to do so safely.

- **🟢 Green = Go**  
  Move ahead, but only after checking the road is clear.

> 🛑 Always stop **behind the stop line**, not on it.
> Never jump a red light. Wait for green even if the road looks empty.

- **Flashing Yellow = Slow down before proceeding**

Some places may resort to a flashing yellow light in the wee hours when there is not much traffic on the road, especially at **night/early morning**.

## Why Road Signs Are Important

Road signs give you **important instructions** about speed, turns, schools, hospitals, and more.

Some common signs:

- ⚠️ **Speed Breaker Ahead**
- 🚸 **School Zone – Drive Slowly**
- 🛣️ **One Way – Do Not Enter from the Wrong Side**
- 🚫 **No Parking / No Horn**

These signs help you stay alert and avoid accidents.

## In India, It’s Even More Important

Indian roads can be **busy and unpredictable**. That’s why following traffic rules is a must:

- Don’t jump red lights, even if the road looks empty.
- Slow down at zebra crossings and let pedestrians pass.
- Don’t ignore signs like “No Entry” or “No U-turn”.

---

## Legal Rules in India

- Violating traffic signals is punishable under Section 177 of the Motor Vehicles Act.
- Penalties include fines up to ₹500 for first offense, higher for repeat violations.
- CCTV and traffic police monitor signal compliance in major cities.

## Myth Busters

| Myth                                | Reality                                                              |
| ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I can cross if no one's watching." | Signals exist to protect everyone, not just when police are present. |
| "Yellow means speed up."            | Yellow means slow down and prepare to stop.                          |
| "Road signs are optional."          | Many signs are legally enforceable and critical for safety.          |

## Quick Challenge

**Scenario:** You approach a green light, but pedestrians are crossing.  
**Question:** Should you keep going?

✅ No. Green means go only if the way is clear. Always yield to pedestrians.
