## What Do Traffic Lights Mean?

- **üî¥ Red = Stop**  
  You must stop your vehicle completely.

- **üü° Yellow = Wait / Slow Down**  
  Get ready to stop or move carefully.

- **üü¢ Green = Go**  
  Move ahead, but only after checking the road is clear.

> üõë Always stop **behind the stop line**, not on it.
> Never jump a red light. Wait for green even if the road looks empty.
