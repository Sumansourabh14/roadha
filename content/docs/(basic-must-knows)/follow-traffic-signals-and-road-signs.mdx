## What Do Traffic Lights Mean?

- **🔴 Red = Stop**  
  You must stop your vehicle completely.

- **🟡 Yellow = Wait / Slow Down**  
  Get ready to stop or move carefully.

- **🟢 Green = Go**  
  Move ahead, but only after checking the road is clear.

> 🛑 Always stop **behind the stop line**, not on it.

| "Road signs are optional."          | Many signs are legally enforceable and critical for safety.           |
