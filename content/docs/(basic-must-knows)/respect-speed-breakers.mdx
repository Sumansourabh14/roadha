# 5.1 Respect Speed Breakers

Speed breakers, also known as speed humps or bumps, are designed to slow down vehicles in high-risk zones like schools, hospitals, and residential areas.

They may feel like a nuisance, but they serve a critical purpose: **saving lives**.

**NOTE:** It is important for the speed breakers to be designed in a safe manner. It should be visible at night. More on this later in this lesson.

## Why Speed Breakers Exist

- Force drivers to reduce speed in sensitive zones
- Protect pedestrians, especially children and elderly
- Prevent accidents at intersections or blind curves
- Encourage safer driving in narrow or crowded streets

> A speed breaker is a warning: “Slow down, lives are nearby.”

## What Happens When You Ignore Them

- Damage to your vehicle’s suspension, tires, or underbody
- Loss of control, especially on two-wheelers
- Risk of hitting pedestrians or cyclists
- Legal penalties for rash or negligent driving

> Speeding over a hump is dangerous. It can also damage your vehicle's suspension if speed is not respected.

## Legal Guidelines

According to Indian Road Congress (IRC) guidelines:

- Speed breakers should be clearly marked and visible
- Drivers must slow down to 10–25 km/h when approaching one
- Rash driving over speed breakers can be penalized under the Motor Vehicles Act

---

## What You Should Do

- Always slow down when you see a speed breaker sign or marking
- Avoid sudden braking
- Reduce speed gradually
- Be extra cautious at night or in low-visibility areas
- Watch for pedestrians near speed breakers

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception                                 | Reality                                                      |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "Speed breakers are annoying."                | They’re placed to protect lives, not to irritate drivers.    |
| "I can just swerve around them."              | Swerving is risky and can cause accidents.                   |
| "There’s no one around, I can speed over it." | You may not see a pedestrian or cyclist until it’s too late. |

In many places, you will see speed breakers built with no markings.

Below is a good example of how a speed breaker should be built.
