## 🧠 Common Misconceptions

| Myth                                | Reality                                                                        |
| ----------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| "I’ll just park for a minute."      | Even short stops can block traffic or cause accidents.                         |
| "There’s no sign, so it’s allowed." | Absence of signage doesn’t mean permission — use common sense and local rules. |
| "Everyone parks here."              | That doesn’t make it legal or safe.                                            |
