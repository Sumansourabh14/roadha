# 7. Use Indicators for Turns and Lane Changes

**Indicators** (also called **turn signals** or **blinkers**) are your vehicle’s way of communicating with others.

They tell drivers, riders, and pedestrians what you plan to do next.

Using them properly is one of the simplest ways to prevent accidents and drive responsibly.

## Why Indicators Matter

- Let others anticipate your movement
- Prevent collisions during turns or lane changes
- Help maintain smooth traffic flow
- Reduce confusion and road rage

> Driving without indicators is like changing lanes blindfolded. Others can’t read your mind.

## Lane Changes on Highways

Changing lanes on highways requires extra caution because vehicles move at high speeds and reaction time is limited.

### ✅ Best Practices

- Use your indicator at least **3 seconds before changing lanes**
- Check **rearview and side mirrors** for approaching vehicles
- Look over your **shoulder** to check blind spots
- Change lanes **smoothly**, avoid sudden swerves
- Avoid frequent lane switching, it confuses others and increases risk

> On Indian highways, abrupt lane changes without signaling are a major cause of side-impact collisions and pile-ups.

---

## Should You Use Indicators in Parking Areas?

**Yes.** Indicators are useful even in parking lots and residential complexes.

### Why It Matters:

- Pedestrians and other drivers may not expect sudden turns or exits
- Helps avoid minor scrapes and confusion in tight spaces
- Signals your intent to reverse, park, or exit a spot

> Even at low speeds, clear communication prevents misunderstandings and keeps everyone safe.

---

## Common Scenarios in India

- Turning into narrow lanes or bylanes
- Overtaking autos, trucks, or cyclists
- Changing lanes on congested highways
- Navigating roundabouts or U-turns
- Parking or pulling over on busy streets

In all these cases, using indicators is not optional, it’s actually essential.

## Turn Indicators for Bikes and Two-Wheelers

Using indicators on bikes is just as important, if not more, than in cars.

Two-wheelers are smaller, harder to spot, and more vulnerable in traffic. Signaling your intent clearly can prevent serious accidents.

### Why It’s Critical:

- **Two-wheelers are often overtaken or squeezed** between larger vehicles. Signaling helps others give you space.
- **Sudden turns without indicators** can lead to side-impact crashes, especially at intersections or roundabouts.
- **Many bike riders rely on hand signals**, but these are less visible at night or in fast-moving traffic.

> In India, a large number of two-wheeler accidents happen due to poor signaling or no signaling at all.

### Best Practices:

- Always use your **electronic indicators**, even for short turns or lane shifts.
- **Avoid hand signals** unless your indicators are broken and get them repaired immediately.
- **Cancel the indicator** after completing the turn to avoid confusing others.
- Use hazard lights only when stopped or in emergencies, not while riding. It may look cool to you but NOT to others.

### Common Mistakes:

- Forgetting to signal while overtaking or merging
- Using hand signals in heavy traffic or at night
- Leaving indicators on after the turn is complete

> Whether you're riding a scooter or a motorcycle, your indicators are your lifeline, use them every time.

---

## What Happens When You Don’t Use Them

- Sudden turns or lane changes can cause side-impact crashes
- Two-wheelers may get squeezed or hit
- Pedestrians may misjudge your movement
- You may be fined for negligent driving

> Many minor accidents in India happen simply because someone didn’t signal their turn.

### NOTE

Just using turn indicators while changing lane is NOT enough.

You also need to look at your side view mirrors & check blindspots before making a turn, ensuring that no vehicle is present on your side or near you.

---

## Legal Rules and Penalties

- Not using indicators is considered **negligent driving** under the Motor Vehicles Act
- Fines range from ₹500 to ₹1,000 depending on the situation
- In case of an accident, failure to signal can be used as evidence of fault

## Common Myths

| Myth                                   | Reality                                                                       |
| -------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I’m just turning into my own street." | Even familiar roads have traffic, always signal.                              |
| "Everyone knows I’ll turn here."       | Never assume, always communicate.                                             |
| "It’s daytime, people can see me."     | Visibility doesn’t replace signaling. Indicators are for clarity.             |
| "Parking areas are informal."          | Indicators help avoid confusion and minor collisions, even in private spaces. |

## What You Should Do

- Use indicators at least 3 seconds before turning or changing lanes
- Cancel the signal after completing the maneuver
- Check mirrors and blind spots before acting
- Use hazard lights only when stopped or in emergencies, not for turning

---

## Key Takeaways

- Indicators are your voice on the road — use them clearly and consistently
- Signaling helps prevent accidents and keeps traffic flowing smoothly
- Don’t skip them just because the road looks empty or informal

## Before you turn, change lanes, or park, ask yourself:

> “Have I told others what I’m about to do?”

Signal your intent. Drive with clarity. Keep everyone safe.
