Driving is a legal responsibility and that means carrying the right documents at all times.

Whether you're on a short trip or a long journey, not having valid papers can lead to fines, vehicle seizure, or worse.

## Essential Documents You Must Carry

| Document                                                  | Purpose                                                   |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Driving License**                                       | Proof that you're legally allowed to drive                |
| **Registration Certificate (RC)**                         | Confirms ownership and registration of the vehicle        |
| **Insurance Certificate**                                 | Covers third-party liability and protects against damages |
| **Pollution Under Control (PUC) Certificate**             | Confirms your vehicle meets emission standards            |
| **Vehicle Fitness Certificate** (for commercial vehicles) | Ensures roadworthiness of transport vehicles              |
| **Permit** (for transport vehicles)                       | Legal permission to operate in specific regions           |

> All documents must be valid, up-to-date, and accessible, either in physical form or digitally via apps like DigiLocker or mParivahan.

## Digital Documents Are Accepted

Under Indian law, digital copies stored in government-approved apps are considered valid. You can use:

- [**DigiLocker**](https://www.digilocker.gov.in/)
- [**mParivahan**](https://mparivahan.parivahan.gov.in/#/)

These apps allow you to store and show documents during traffic checks without needing physical copies.

## Common Misconceptions

| Myth                              | Reality                                                          |
| --------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "I only need my license."         | You need multiple documents, not just one.                       |
| "Digital copies aren’t accepted." | DigiLocker and mParivahan are legally valid.                     |
| "I’ll show them later if asked."  | You must present documents immediately when asked by an officer. |

## What You Should Do

- Keep all documents updated and renewed before expiry
- Store digital copies in approved apps
- Carry physical copies when traveling long distances or through rural areas
- Ensure your insurance and PUC are renewed on time

## Key Takeaways

## Before you start your vehicle, ask yourself:
