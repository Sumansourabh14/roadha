Driving under the influence of alcohol is one of the most dangerous and irresponsible things you can do on the road. It impairs your judgment, slows your reaction time, and puts lives at risk, including your own.

In India, drunk driving is a major contributor to fatal road accidents.

## What Alcohol Does to Your Driving Ability

Even small amounts of alcohol can:

- Blur your vision and reduce coordination
- Slow down your reflexes and decision-making
- Make you overconfident and reckless
- Impair your ability to judge speed, distance, and traffic signals

> You may feel “fine,” but your brain isn’t functioning at full capacity.

## Legal Limits and Penalties in India

- The legal blood alcohol concentration (BAC) limit in India is **0.03%** (30 mg of alcohol per 100 ml of blood).
- This is roughly equal to one small drink — but varies by body weight and metabolism.
- If caught driving under the influence:
  - Fine up to ₹10,000
  - Up to 6 months imprisonment (first offense)
  - License suspension or cancellation
  - Repeat offenses can lead to harsher penalties

Police use breath analyzers and conduct random checks, especially during festivals and weekends.

## Common Excuses and Why They’re Dangerous

| Excuse                             | Reality                                               |
| ---------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| "I’ve only had one drink."         | Even one drink can impair judgment and reaction time. |
| "I drive better when I’m relaxed." | Alcohol doesn’t relax, it dulls your senses.          |
| "There’s no police around."        | Accidents don’t wait for enforcement.                 |
