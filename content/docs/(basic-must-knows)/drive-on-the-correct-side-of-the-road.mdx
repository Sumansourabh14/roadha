Driving on the correct side of the road isn’t just a rule, it’s a life-saving habit. In India, vehicles must always drive on the **left side of the road**, with overtaking from the right. This simple rule helps maintain order, prevent collisions, and protect everyone on the road.

---

## What Is the Correct Side in India?

India follows **left-hand traffic**, which means:

- Drive on the **left side** of the road.
- **Overtake from the right**.
- Pedestrians should walk facing traffic (on the right side of the road).

This system is designed to ensure visibility, predictability, and safe flow of vehicles.

---

## What Happens When You Drive on the Wrong Side?

Driving on the wrong side, even for a short stretch, can be deadly:

- Head-on collisions with fast-moving vehicles
- Confusion for other drivers and pedestrians
- Increased risk at intersections and turns
- Legal penalties and fines

> In many Indian cities, wrong-side driving is a major cause of fatal accidents, especially involving two-wheelers and pedestrians.

## 🛣️ Understanding Road Lines and Markings

Road markings are silent guides that help maintain order and safety. They tell drivers where to go, when to stop, and how to stay in their lane.

Ignoring them can lead to confusion, collisions, and fines.

Here are the most common center line markings and what they mean:

### 1. Single Continuous Line (Center)

<img

    "https://d1hv7ee95zft1i.cloudfront.net/custom/blog-post-photo/gallery/5ac30ed074a5f.jpg"
  }
/>

- 🚫 **Do not cross.**
- Used to separate traffic moving in opposite directions.
- Overtaking or changing lanes across this line is **illegal and dangerous**.
- Common on narrow roads, curves, and areas with poor visibility.

### Look how this driver in the below video crosses the white single continuous line

  referrerPolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin"
  allowFullScreen

Don't be like this driver. It can cause accidents.

> Think of this line as a wall. You must stay on your side.

### 2. Broken Line (Center)

  }
/>

- ✅ **Overtaking allowed, but with caution.**
- Separates traffic moving in opposite directions.
- You may cross this line to overtake or change lanes **only if the road ahead is clear**.

> Always check for oncoming traffic before crossing a broken line.

---

### 3. Double Continuous Lines

  }
/>

- 🚫 **Strictly no crossing.**
- Indicates high-risk zones like flyovers, highways, or blind turns.
- Crossing these lines is a serious violation and can lead to fines or accidents.

> Treat this like a double barrier. Stay in your lane.

---

### 4. Continuous + Broken Line (Dual Center)

  }
/>

- 🚗 If you're on the **broken line side**, overtaking is allowed.
- 🚫 If you're on the **continuous line side**, overtaking is prohibited.
- Designed for roads with uneven visibility or elevation.

> Follow the rule based on your side of the marking.

---

### 5. Edge Lines and Lane Dividers

- **White lines** mark the edge of the road or divide lanes moving in the same direction.
- Stay within your lane and avoid drifting across lines.
- Use indicators before changing lanes.

## Common Excuses and Why They’re Dangerous

| Excuse                          | Reality                                                |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| "It’s just a short cut."        | Even short wrong-side driving can cause fatal crashes. |
| "There’s no traffic right now." | You can’t predict sudden vehicles or pedestrians.      |
| "Everyone does it here."        | That doesn’t make it safe or legal.                    |
