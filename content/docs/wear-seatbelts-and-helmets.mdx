# 🛡️ 1. Wear Seatbelts and Helmets

Road accidents are a serious concern in India. Every year, thousands of lives are lost on Indian roads due to avoidable mistakes—one of the most common being **not wearing seatbelts or helmets**. These two simple safety habits can be the difference between life and death.

## 🚘 Why Seatbelts Matter

Seatbelts are not just for long highway drives. Whether you're driving within the city or on a short trip, wearing a seatbelt:

- **Reduces the risk of death by up to 50%** in case of a crash
- Prevents you from being thrown out of the vehicle
- Helps you stay in control of the vehicle in an emergency

> 🚨 **Important:** As per Indian law under the Motor Vehicles Act, 2019, wearing seatbelts is mandatory for both **front and rear seat passengers**. Fines for not wearing one can go up to ₹1,000.

## 🛵 Why Helmets Save Lives

India has one of the largest numbers of two-wheelers in the world, and unfortunately, a high number of **fatal road accidents involve bikers**. Helmets:

- Protect your head and brain from severe injuries
- Reduce the chance of fatality by **over 70%**
- Are legally required for both **riders and pillion passengers**

> 🧠 A helmet isn’t just a formality. Make sure it's **ISI-certified**, properly strapped, and fits well.

## 🇮🇳 India-Specific Challenges

In India, many people still ignore these basic safety measures because of:

- **Overconfidence:** "I’m just going around the corner."
- **Heat or discomfort:** Especially in summer, people avoid helmets.
- **Lack of enforcement:** In some areas, traffic rules aren't enforced strictly.

But none of these reasons justify risking your life or someone else’s.

Wearing a seatbelt or helmet takes less than 10 seconds — but not wearing one
can cost you your life.

## ✅ What You Can Do

- Always wear your seatbelt, even in the back seat.
- Never allow anyone to ride a two-wheeler without a helmet.
- Lead by example — your actions influence others.
- Educate friends, family, and especially young riders.
