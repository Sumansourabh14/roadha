It might seem thrilling to stand or lean out of a sunroof while the car is moving, especially during celebrations or road trips.

But this behavior is extremely **dangerous and illegal**.

It puts passengers at serious risk of injury or death and distracts other drivers.

---

## Why It’s So Dangerous

- **No protection:** Your head and upper body are completely exposed.
- **Sudden stops or swerves:** You can be thrown out or hit the roof edge.
- **Flying debris or low-hanging objects:** Trees, wires, or signboards can cause fatal head injuries.
- **Distraction to others:** It draws attention and may cause other drivers to lose focus.
- **Risk of falling:** Especially if the vehicle hits a bump or speed breaker.

> Hanging out of a sunroof turns a moving vehicle into a hazard, for you and everyone around you.

> In childhood, we were taught NOT to hang our heads out of the bus windows. Does this NOT apply to the sunroof?

- Can lead to fines, license suspension, or charges against the driver
- Police may book passengers and drivers for endangering public safety

## Common Misconceptions

| Misconception                           | Reality                                                                     |
| --------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| "It’s just for a few seconds."          | Accidents happen in milliseconds, even short exposure is risky.             |
| "We’re driving slowly."                 | Speed doesn’t eliminate risk. Sudden stops or bumps can still cause injury. |
| "Everyone does it during celebrations." | That doesn’t make it safe or legal.                                         |
| "Let me enjoy the hilly area view."     | You can enjoy the view through the windows too.                             |

## Before you open the sunroof, ask yourself:

> “Is this safe or just risky fun?”

<span className="text-red-500 text-xl font-bold uppercase">
  It is for your own safety. But still if you choose to hang out of the sunroof
  and something happens, do not blame the government.
</span>

Stay inside. Stay alive.
