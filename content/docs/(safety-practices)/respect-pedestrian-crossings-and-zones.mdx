Pedestrians are the most vulnerable road users. As a driver, your responsibility is not just to avoid hitting them, it’s to actively protect them.

Respecting pedestrian crossings and zones is a basic but often ignored rule in India.

---

## What Are Pedestrian Crossings and Zones?

- **Zebra crossings:** Marked white stripes where pedestrians have the right of way
- **Footpaths and sidewalks:** Designated walking areas that must remain vehicle-free
- **School zones and residential areas:** Spaces where extra caution is required
- **Traffic signals with pedestrian lights:** Indicate when pedestrians can cross safely

> These zones are designed to protect lives, not slow you down.

---

## The Reality on Indian Roads

- Vehicles often stop on or block zebra crossings
- Pedestrians are forced to weave through moving traffic
- Two-wheelers and cars frequently drive on footpaths
- Drivers rarely yield to pedestrians, even at signals

> This behavior leads to thousands of preventable injuries and deaths every year.

---

## Legal Rules and Penalties

- Failing to yield at a pedestrian crossing: ₹1,000 fine
- Driving or parking on footpaths: ₹500–₹2,000 fine
- Hitting a pedestrian due to negligence can lead to **criminal charges**

> The law protects pedestrians and so should you.

## Common Misconceptions

| Myth                                              | Reality                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| "Pedestrians should wait for vehicles to pass."   | At crossings, vehicles must stop not the people. |
| "There’s no one around, I can stop on the zebra." | Crossings must be kept clear at all times.       |
| "Two-wheelers can use footpaths in traffic."      | Footpaths are for people, not shortcuts.         |

---

## What You Should Do

- Always slow down near crossings, schools, and residential areas
- Stop completely at zebra crossings when pedestrians are waiting
- Never block or park on pedestrian paths
- Avoid honking or pressuring pedestrians to hurry
- Educate others, especially young drivers about pedestrian rights

## Key Takeaways

- Pedestrian zones are sacred treat them with respect
- Yielding to pedestrians is not optional, it’s the law
- A few seconds of patience can save a life

## Before you roll past that crossing, ask yourself:

> Would I want someone to stop if my child were crossing?

Respect the stripes. Protect every step.
