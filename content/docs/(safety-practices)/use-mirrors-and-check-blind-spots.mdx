Safe driving isn’t just about looking ahead, it’s about being aware of everything around you.

Mirrors and blind spot checks are critical tools to prevent accidents, especially in India’s crowded traffic conditions.

## What Are Blind Spots?

Blind spots are areas around your vehicle that you **cannot see directly** through mirrors. They vary depending on the vehicle type:

- **Cars:** Areas beside and slightly behind the vehicle
- **Two-wheelers:** Limited rear visibility without mirrors
- **Trucks and buses:** Large blind zones on both sides and behind

> Blind spots hide pedestrians, cyclists, and vehicles, making them a major cause of collisions.

---

## Why It Matters in India

- Heavy mix of cars, bikes, autos, buses, and pedestrians
- Frequent lane changes and overtaking in congested roads
- Two-wheelers often squeeze into side gaps
- Pedestrians may cross suddenly from blind zones
- Trucks and buses with large blind spots pose extra risks

> Checking mirrors and blind spots is vital in India’s unpredictable traffic.

## How to Use Mirrors Correctly

- Adjust **rear-view mirror** to cover the entire rear window
- Set **side mirrors** to minimize overlap with rear-view coverage
- Glance at mirrors every few seconds to stay aware
- Use mirrors before **changing lanes, turning, or overtaking**
- Combine mirror checks with **shoulder checks** for blind spots
