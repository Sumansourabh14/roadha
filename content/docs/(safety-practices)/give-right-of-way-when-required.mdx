Right of way isn’t just about courtesy. It’s about **safety, legality, and keeping traffic moving**. Failing to yield when required can lead to collisions, confusion, and road rage.

In India’s complex traffic environment, knowing when to give way is essential.

## What Is Right of Way?

Right of way means allowing another vehicle, pedestrian, or emergency service to proceed before you when traffic rules or conditions demand it.

> It’s not about who’s faster, it’s about who has the legal priority.

---

## Common Right of Way Rules in India

- **At intersections without signals:** Vehicles on the right have priority
- **At roundabouts:** Vehicles already inside the circle have right of way
- **Pedestrian crossings:** Pedestrians always have priority
- **Emergency vehicles:** Ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles must be given way immediately
- **Turning vehicles:** Straight-moving traffic has priority over turning vehicles
- **Hill roads:** Vehicles going uphill have right of way over those coming downhill

> These rules are part of the Motor Vehicles Act and must be followed at all times.

---

## What Happens When You Don’t Yield

- **Accidents and injuries**, especially at intersections and crossings
- **Traffic jams and chaos**
- **Legal penalties**, fines and possible license points
- **Aggression and road rage** from other drivers

> Giving way isn’t losing. It’s choosing safety over ego.

## Common Misconceptions

| Myth                              | Reality                                       |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| "If I’m faster, I can go first."  | Speed doesn’t override legal priority.        |
| "I didn’t see the other vehicle." | You’re responsible for awareness and caution. |
| "Everyone pushes through here."   | That doesn’t make it right or safe.           |

## What You Should Do

- Slow down at intersections and check for other vehicles or pedestrians
- Yield to emergency vehicles immediately, even if it means pulling over
- Follow lane discipline and avoid cutting across traffic
- Be patient. Giving way often prevents delays, not causes them
- Educate new drivers and riders about right of way rules

---

## Key Takeaways

- Right of way rules exist to prevent confusion and collisions
- Yielding is a sign of responsible driving not weakness
- In India’s traffic, giving way can save lives
