# 🚦 2. Follow Traffic Signals and Road Signs

Traffic signals and road signs are there to **guide and protect us**. When everyone follows them, roads become safer and more organized.

## 🔴🟡🟢 What Do Traffic Lights Mean?

- **🔴 Red = Stop**  
  You must stop your vehicle completely.

- **🟡 Yellow = Wait / Slow Down**  
  Get ready to stop or move carefully.

- **🟢 Green = Go**  
  Move ahead, but only after checking the road is clear.

> 🛑 Always stop **behind the stop line**, not on it.

## 🚧 Why Road Signs Are Important

Road signs give you **important instructions** about speed, turns, schools, hospitals, and more.

Some common signs:

- ⚠️ **Speed Breaker Ahead**
- 🚸 **School Zone – Drive Slowly**
- 🛣️ **One Way – Do Not Enter from the Wrong Side**
- 🚫 **No Parking / No Horn**

These signs help you stay alert and avoid accidents.

## 🇮🇳 In India, It’s Even More Important

Indian roads can be **busy and unpredictable**. That’s why following traffic rules is a must:

- Don’t jump red lights, even if the road looks empty.
- Slow down at zebra crossings and let pedestrians pass.
- Don’t ignore signs like “No Entry” or “No U-turn”.

## ✅ Safe Habits to Follow

- Look at signals and signs **at every junction**.
- Don’t follow the crowd—follow the **rules**.
- Teach others, especially kids and new riders.
